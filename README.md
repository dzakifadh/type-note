# Notex

Notex is a simple note, the purpose of this (super) mini project is to get started with typescript, and refresh my knowledge in backend stuff (I'm a frontend and feel curious with backend :sweat_smile:). It's a MERN stack using full typescript.

> This is an undone project and the progress is over 85%, i can't continue right now because there are side jobs need to handle :relieved:
